# HandEmojiDetection

## Tools
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Python

## Overview

In this project, I am capturing hand detection through a video camera. Once a user places a hand pose in front of the camera, it will detect the position of the hand by the various landmarks that are placed on each position of the hand. By detecing these landmarks, the program will decide which emoji matches the hand pose.
